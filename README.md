# Doubt Busters - Software Engineering Project
This is the github repository of our Doubt Forum Project - Doubt Busters. 
In the project, the user can signup and login using his mail and password and then he can post his/her doubts according to the subject tags and answer other's doubts. The user can also access all the questions that he asked in his personal dashboard. 
The questions are stored in a database which can be searched through the search bar and can be filtered using tags, in a reverse chronological order of the time when it was posted. A user can also reply to the answer of any question and delete it in case of any errors. 
Our website is created using React Js, Css, and Firebase technologies.



## Once the project is downloaded, run the commands given below to run the website on your localhost.



# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
